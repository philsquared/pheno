Pheno is a modern, effects-based, language.
It has many of the semantics of Rust, including borrow-checking and traits, but a syntax that is closer to Python, with a bit of ML and other influences mixed in.

Pheno is the top member of a family of languages. Currently the other languages are [Ribo](http://ribo-lang.org) - a declarative language (like JSON or YAML, but with a static type system) and Chromo - a scripting language used as part of the build system, Helix.

An introduction to the language will be coming soon. In the meantime the basic type system is in common with [Ribo](http://ribo-lang.org), so check out the intro there.
